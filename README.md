## NetCode

**NetCode** is a simple C# program that listens for incoming shellcode over a network connection and executes it. It provides a basic framework for remote code execution, making it a valuable tool for security researchers, penetration testers, and those interested in understanding the execution of shellcode within a controlled environment.

### Features:

- Listens for incoming connections on a specified port.
- Receives and allocates memory for incoming shellcode.
- Executes the received shellcode within the program's address space.
- Cleans up allocated memory and resources after execution.

### Usage:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the program using your preferred C# development environment.
3. Run the program, specifying the port you want to listen on.
4. Connect to the listening port and send your shellcode for execution.

### Important Note:

Use this program responsibly and only in controlled, legal, and ethical environments. Executing arbitrary code can be risky and should be done with caution.
